This repository includes the analysis codes in the paper: Assessment of the impact of meteorological factors on pathogen transmission and reporting in a mechanistic transmission model: the population case of mumps. A **climate-driven mechanistic transmission model** was used to investigate the impact of meteorological factors on i) **transmission rate** and ii) **reporting rate** of mumps infection, using different threshold and lag conversions. The manusript was submitted to the Plos Computational Biology.
