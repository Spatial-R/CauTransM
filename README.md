# CauTransM
This repository include the analysis of environmental factors on the Mumps dynamic in Zhejiang Province. We constructured a causal transmission model with threshold-conversion method to analysis the threshold and lag effect of mean temperature and humidity on causality fof infectious disease.  two distinct hypotheses: the impact of meteorological factors on i) mumps transmission rate and ii) mumps virulence (as measured by reporting rate).
