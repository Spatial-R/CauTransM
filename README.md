# CauTransM
This repository includes the codes of causal transmission model which have been used to assess the effect of environmental factors on Mumps dynamic in Zhejiang Province. We constructured a **causal transmission model** with threshold-conversion method to analysis the threshold and lag effect of mean temperature and humidity on causality of Mumps. Two distinct hypotheses were constructed: the impact of meteorological factors on i) mumps **transmission rate** and ii) mumps virulence (as measured by **reporting rate**).
